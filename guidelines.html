<h1>Community Guidelines</h1>
<p>VIOLENCE: Any threat of violence towards people or groups is prohibited. Violence does not move a conversation and is commonly used by those that lack any real argument.</p>
<p>RACISM: Racist content is prohibited. Those that want to keep racism alive by interjecting it into conversations or art do not present a strong argument. The only way to truly end racism is to ignore the racists, until then, you are only giving them a platform.</p>
<p>SEXUAL CONTENT: We do not want pornography of any kind on this platform. It is disgusting and worthless. This platform is anti-pedophile. No pedophile should be free, they should be removed from society. This platform condemns anyone that is in support of pedophiles or promotions of pornography.</p>
<p>POLITICAL LEANING: The Guest House would like to remain apolitical. Both parties in the political system are failures and are entirley made up of failures. No elected offical is a respectable person and they all do an awful job at providing for Americans.</p>
<p>FINAL STATEMENT: The Guest House is a platform for those not invited to the house party. The content uploaded here can be any style and any feeling. It's okay to be frustrated and angry but promotions of sex and violence only make those feelings more severe. We want users to tap into their core beliefs and display them in their art.</p>
